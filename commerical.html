        This farming required a large amount of labour and large areas.

        The products are processed in the farm itself of nearby factories.
        These products do not directly go to the sale. After growing these products, the leaves are roasted in the
        factories or farms. These are all tree crops.
        This farming required large transportation because the products of this farming are transported to one area
        to another area.
