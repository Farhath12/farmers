        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subsistence farming is described as family farming because it meets the needs of the farmer’s family. It
                required a low level of technology and household labour.</li>
            <li>These types of farming produce small output. They do not use high yielding varieties of old seeds and
                fertilizer.</li>
            <li>Facilities like electricity and irrigation are not available for them. Most subsistence farming is done
                manually.</li>
        </ul>
        Subsistence farming can be classified in two types:-</p>


        <p> Intensive subsistence farming:-

            It includes a small plot of land and for growing crops, simple and low-cost tools, and more labour. The word
            intensive means hard work, so it means it requires more labour.
            The climate of this farming with a large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permit growing more
            than one crop annually in the same land.
            Rice is the main crop of this farming. Other crops include wheat, maize, pulses, and oilseeds.
            This farming is spread in the thickly populated area of the monsoon regions. These regions are south, South
            East, East Asia.</p>
        <p> Primitive subsistence farming:-

            It includes shifting cultivation and nomadic herding.</p>

        <p>Shifting cultivation:-

            This cultivation spread in thickly forested areas like amazon basin, tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and
            northeast India. These are the areas of heavy rainfall.
            It is a quick regeneration of vegetation.
            The process of shifting cultivation is that first of all the land is cleared by falling trees and burning
            them. Then the ash of the trees is mixed with the land soil.
            This cultivation farming is grown on crops like maize, yam, potatoes, and cassava. Crops are grown in this
            land for 2 or 3 years. Then the land left out because fertilizer of the soil decreases.
            The farmers move to the other land to repeat this process. This is also called ‘slash and burn agriculture’.
            Shifting cultivation is known by different names in different parts of the world –</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Jhumming North East India</li>
            <li>Milpa Mexico</li>
            <li>Roca brazil</li>
            <li>Ladang Malaysia</li>
        </ol>

        Nomadic Herding:
        This type of farming is done on the semi-dry area and dry area. Like central Asia, some parts of India like
        Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir.
        The process of this farming is that the herdsmen move one place to another place for feed and water, along
        defined routes.
        The most used animals in this farming are sheep, camel, yak, and goats.
        The product of this farming is milk, meat, and other to the herdsman and their families.
